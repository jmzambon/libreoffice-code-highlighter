If you'd like to contribute to localize Codehighlighter 2, there are three files concerned with translatable strings:
- codehighlighter/Addons.xcu (for menu items)
- codehighlighter/description/desc_xx.txt (for add-on description, where "xx" stands for
the iso language code)
- the .po files located under locales/xx/LC_MESSAGES. This is the main file for ui strings. Choose any of the already existing .po files, translate each string to your locale and send me the result or submit a merge request.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you need help creating or modifying these files.
